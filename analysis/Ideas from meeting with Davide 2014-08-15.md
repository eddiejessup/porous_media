# Summary of meeting with Davide 2014/08/15

- Do crossover thing of diffusivity as a function of rotational diffusivity for $\phi > 0$, but now for drift speed with constant $\chi$, should hopefully see a crossover also
- Do analytic derivation of separation of density and orientation fields, numerically integrate and compare with agent-based
- *DONE* Modify existing ODE for chemical food eating, to incorporate factor of $c$ on right-hand side; justification is that food gets more scarce as it's eaten. Note this makes $c_0$ an important parameter where it wasn't before.
- Do simulations of single-layer chemotaxis wave as a function of the number of obstacles
- Do report on already done stuff on chemotaxis waves, send to Davide
- Think about Ito noise and if and where it matters; think about random walker on a potential and how the form of noise distorts the results v.s. the theoretical result
- Flesh out thinking on how obstacles can induce transverse drifts in the waves, and how this could affect drift speeds (could maybe increase drift speed locally, as it could form high-density clusters)
- Think about form of response, and send Davide paper on existence of travelling waves as dependent on the form of the response
- Think about why RTPs do temporal chemotaxis better than ABPs

- Try to come up with an expression for the expected drift speed of a wave, close to the stable wave limit

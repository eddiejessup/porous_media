      "In 1D this was easy, because due to the assumption of a low tumble rate (because we're close to the stable wave limit) there was one type of event that took particles away -- a single tumble, to the opposite direction, at some place in the lattice cell:\n",

      "- The lost wave fraction is simply half the fraction that tumble anywhere in the cell\n",
      "- The time spent in a cell is simply the wave crossing time for both tumbling and non-tumbling cells, due to the symmetric distribution of single-tumble events (see other notebook for elaboration)\n",

      "This also means that there isn't really a 'broadening' of the wave, since the two populations (wave and back-tumbling) are travelling in opposite directions. (Of course in 1D at some point we aren't close to the stable wave limit, so multiple tumbles then *can* happen, and non-negligible broadening can then occur because the particle behaviour goes from being ballistic to diffusive.)"

      "In this case, even assuming a low tumble rate there is a broadening effect, because a particle's initial wave-directed velocity can 'diffuse' into the other dimension through tumbling, meaning the wave-directed velocity component can take a continuous range of values ($\\cos(\\theta)$ rather than $\\pm 1$).\n",
      "\n",
      "This also means that we can't assume a maximum of a single tumble over a cell, because there's a probability that all the velocity is transferred to the transverse direction, meaning the particle tumbles to be perpendicular to the wave. This means that the time spent in the cell diverges. We need to consider multiple tumbles to rectify this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put more mathematically, in 2D tumbling picks a new direction from a uniform distribution of $\\theta$ on $[-pi..\\pi]$, which then gives a speed in the wave propagation direction of $\\cos(\\theta)$. The time until intersection with the cell's wave-directed edge is proportional to $\\dfrac{1}{\\cos(\\theta)}$.\n",
